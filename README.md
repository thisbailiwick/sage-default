# Custom Sage Default Template
This is based off of Sage [8.5.4](https://github.com/roots/sage/tree/8.5.4). [Documentation](https://github.com/roots/sage/tree/8.5.4#sage) for that branch of the repository still applies.

This theme is currently used in [wp-default-init](https://github.com/roots/sage/tree/8.5.4#sage).

**TODO**

* Update to current [sage](https://github.com/roots/sage) theme.
